this is first shit i build (06D/07/2023)

                       "Calculator"


so I wanna say this because there are some limits to using this application

>Please don't use a lot of numeric characters because the display may not be enough for an answer
> Please don't use string applications will clash
> I couldn't add a clear button (ill update the application later)
> After you get an answer you have to clear the text box by yourself
>And please don't maximize this won't maximize

so I know this is not a perfect one but ill develop it, I need to know urs probs and errors and features to add


thanks, guys :)
