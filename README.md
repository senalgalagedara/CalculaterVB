Hi guys I am Senal Galagedara and this is my first software (06D/07/2023)

                       "Calculator"


so I wanna say this because there are some limits to using this application

>plz don't use lot of numeric characters because the display may not be enough for an answer
> please don't use string application will clash
> I couldn't add a clear button (tbh I don't know how to code (ill update the application later))
> After you got an answer you have to clear the text box by yourself


so I know this is not a perfect one but ill develop it, I just need to know urs probs and erros and features to add


thanks guys :)
